# Meilisearch

currently MS only contains a modified dump of the drinks.json file (type field removed and id increased to match prismas entries)

## Get Started
- install meilisearch and run `./meilisearch` (it creates the database in your current working directory)

- then upload the data by running `./upload-drinks.sh`, note that you might need to `chmod +x upload-drinks.sh` first
